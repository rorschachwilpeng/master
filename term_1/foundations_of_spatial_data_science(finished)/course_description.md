# Master's foundations_of_spatial_data_science(finished) description

## Course Brief Introduction:
### English:
This module provides students with an introduction to data science through a mix discussion and coursework built around an applied spatial analysis problem using real-world data. The module is intended to complement Quantitative Methods and Geographic Information Systems by showing how geographic and quantitative concepts are applied in a computational context as part of a larger piece of spatial data science analysis.

This module is 15 credit, containing two assessment. The percentages of course credits for the two assignments are 30%, 70%. 

The first assessment - Data Audit (30%), This individual assessment is due 21 November 2022 @ 5pm (after Reading Week). The data set for which the ‘biography’ will be written is the Inside Airbnb data for London. This assessment will be quite straightforward if you have been doing the readings and keeping up with the basics of using Markdown, and rather challenging if you have not. This assessment is, in part, a technical ‘test run’ for the policy report: you will not fail this assessment if you decide to write it in Word or some other editor, but now is a good time to check that you understand how Quarto works before beginning work on the other two assessments or on your dissertation!

The second assessment - Data+Policy Briefing(50%) + Individual_Reflection(20%), This is a collaborative project due 18 January 2022 @ 5pm that you will undertake in a small group of no more than four students. The project is intended to resemble real-world data science ways of working: you will be part of a small team, you will need to figure out how to work effectively together, you will need to jointly produce an output in which you all have confidence. There are two components to this assessment: a Policy Briefing (worth 60% of grade for this assessment), and a Reproducible Analysis (worth 40% of the grade for this assessment).

该模块通过混合讨论和围绕使用真实世界数据的应用空间分析问题构建的课程作业，向学生介绍数据科学。该模块旨在通过展示地理和定量概念如何在计算环境中应用作为更大的空间数据科学分析的一部分来补充定量方法和地理信息系统。

该模块为 15 学分，包含两个评估。两项作业的课程学分百分比分别为30%、70%。

第一次评估 - 数据审核（30%），这项个人评估将于 2022 年 11 月 21 日下午 5 点（阅读周之后）到期。将为其编写“传记”的数据集是伦敦的 Inside Airbnb 数据。如果您一直在阅读并掌握使用 Markdown 的基础知识，那么此评估将非常简单，如果没有，则相当具有挑战性。此评估在某种程度上是政策报告的技术“试运行”：如果您决定用 Word 或其他编辑器编写它，您将不会通过此评估，但现在是检查您是否理解 Quarto 的好时机在开始其他两个评估或您的论文之前工作！

第二次评估 - 数据+政策简报（50%）+ Individual_Reflection（20%），这是一个合作项目，截止日期为 2022 年 1 月 18 日下午 5 点，您将在不超过四名学生的小组中进行。该项目旨在模拟真实世界的数据科学工作方式：你将成为一个小团队的一员，你需要弄清楚如何有效地合作，你需要共同产生一个大家都有信心的输出.此评估有两个组成部分：政策简报（占此评估成绩的 60%）和可重复分析（占此评估成绩的 40%）。


## Individual Reflection:
### English:
This course focuses on python programming and learning about the spatial analysis of Airbnb's data set and the corresponding sharing economy of Airbnb. Since I have learned programming before, this course is not difficult for me. The first cw conducted a theoretical analysis on the Airbnb data set, and the score was not bad, but the teacher's comment suggested that I should stand in a more macro perspective when thinking about the problem. The second cw is a group assignment where our group researched the impact of covid on Airbnb short/long term listings. The job is divided into two parts: code and report. 80% of the code part was completed by me, and the report part did not spend much thought because I still needed to catch up with the cw of the qm class and modify the code of this assignment at the same time.

Course difficulty（max:5🌟）：🌟🌟

这门课主要关注python编程，以及针对Airbnb的数据集和Airbnb对应的共享经济在空间分析上的影响进行学习。因为我之前学过编程，所以这门课对我来说并不难。第一个cw针对Airbnb数据集进行理论分析，分数还行，但是老师的评语建议我在思考问题的时候可以站在一个更宏观的视角。第二个cw是小组作业，我们小组研究了covid对Airbnb短/长期房源产生的影响。作业分成了代码和report两个部分。代码部分80%是由我完成的，report部分因为同期还需要赶qm课的cw和修改这个作业的代码并没有花太多心思。
