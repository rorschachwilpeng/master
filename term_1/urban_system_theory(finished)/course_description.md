# Master's urban systems theory(finished) description

## Course Brief Introduction:
### English
The 'Urban Systems Theory' module contributes to the wider MSc program by providing a social science basis for the discipline of urban spatial science. It will give you the good theoretical background you need to place any work you do in an urban setting. The ideas presented here will build on this if you choose the Term 2 module 'Smart Cities: Environment, Policy and Government', but even if you don't, this module will have foundational importance for your dissertation. We'll practice academic research methods and critical scientific engagement, all of which will help prepare you for a career in academia, government or industry.

This module is 15 credits and consists of two assessments. The course credit percentages for the two assignments are 50% and 50%, respectively.

First assessment - essay (50%)
Questions: a) Suppose your task is to determine whether a standard city model is suitable for the city. what will you do? What data and information will you collect and how will you use it? b) To what extent do you think the model applies to your city? Do you see any limitations of the model? Explain your answer.

Second assessment - essay (50%),
Based on the paper: https://doi.org/10.1111/tran.12522
1. Describe the author's epistemological orientation? What aspects of your research can you relate to a particular epistemological paradigm?
2. How did the authors attempt to study the characteristics of neighborhoods in their study?
3. Based on the answers above, reflect on the strengths and limitations of this study. what space
and social processes are considered?
4. Do you think the authors achieved their research goals? what the extra work might be
Contribute to the research area of this study?

“城市系统理论”模块通过为城市空间科学学科提供社会科学基础，为更广泛的理学硕士课程做出贡献。它将为您提供将您所做的任何工作置于城市环境中所需的良好理论背景。如果您选择术语 2 模块“智慧城市：环境、政策和政府”，此处介绍的想法将以其为基础，但即使您不选择，该模块对您的论文也具有基础重要性。我们将实践学术研究方法和批判性的科学参与，所有这些都将帮助您为在学术界、政府或行业的职业生涯做好准备。

该模块为 15 学分，包含两个评估。两项作业的课程学分百分比分别为50%、50%。

第一次评估 - essay（50%）
问题：a) 假设您的任务是确定标准城市模型是否适用于该城市。你会怎么做？您会收集哪些数据和信息，您将如何使用它们？ b) 您认为该模型在多大程度上适用于您所在的城市？您认为该模型有任何局限性吗？解释你的答案。

第二次评估 - essay（50%），
基于论文：https://doi.org/10.1111/tran.12522
1. 描述作者的认识论取向？您可以将研究的哪些方面与特定的认识论范式联系起来？
2. 作者如何在他们的研究中尝试研究街区的特征？
3. 根据以上答案，反思本研究的优势和局限性。什么空间
和社会过程是否被考虑？
4. 你认为作者达到了他们的研究目的吗？额外的工作可能是什么
对本研究的研究领域有贡献吗？


## Individual Reflection:
### English:
This course is theoretically biased, with a basic framework for studying the theory of urban planning and spatial analysis. In this course, I don't feel that I have learned much useful knowledge, because the knowledge is abstract and not detailed enough for me. But because my ability to write essays is weaker than data analysis code implementation, I think this course can exercise my ability to look at problems and essays in a macro perspective

Assessment 1: I put a lot of effort into this essay, but the score is very low. The main reason is that the angle of analysis of the problem is wrong. In my thesis I proposed a reusable bit-rent construction model, but actually. The teacher pointed out in the comments that I did not analyze the model fit of the target city (Liverpool) using bit-rent as an entry point. I also made the same mistake in the business course I took as a senior undergraduate (the entry point is based on the detailed model and technical implementation), which reminded me that in the subsequent problem analysis, I should first understand the meaning of the question and find the reasonableness in the demand. The angle of entry, and the focus when analyzing the problem (emphasis on models/theories. Business angles/urban construction angles...etc..)

Assessment 2: I didn't put in a lot of effort in this essay, because after handing in this ddl, I will have Christmas vacation, and the fsds exam made me a little tired at the time, so this cw is a bit of a stretch.... I won't make a summary.

### Chinese:
这门课程偏向理论，基础地框架学习了城市规划以及空间分析的理论。在本课程中，我并没有觉得学到太多有用的知识，因为这些知识对我而言很抽象晦涩且不够细化。但是因为我写essay的能力相比数据分析代码实现较弱，我认为这门课有锻炼到我宏观看问题和essay的能力

Assessment 1:这篇essay我下了很大的功夫，但是分数却很低。原因主要是分析问题的角度不对。在我的论文中我提出了一个可以复用的bit-rent构建模型，但是实际上。老师在评语中指出，我并没有针对目标城市（利物浦），利用bit-rent为切入点，对该城市的模型适配度进行分析。同样的错误我在本科大四选修的商科课程中也犯过（切入点是基于细化模型，技术实现），这提醒了我在之后的问题分析中应该先理解题意，找到需求中的合理切入角度，和分析问题时的侧重（侧重模型/理论。商业角度/城市构造角度...etc..）

Assessment 2:这篇essay并没有下很大的功夫，因为交完这个ddl就放圣诞假了，加上fsds的考试搞得当时有点累，所以这个cw有点划水....就不做总结了。
