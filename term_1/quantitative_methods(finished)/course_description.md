# Master's quantitative methods(finished) description

## Course Brief Introduction:
### English:
This module aims to demonstrate the integral role that quantitative methods play in research. Students will be introduced to a range of quantitative methods in statistics, modeling and data analysis for use as tools in other disciplines. Throughout the course, the emphasis will be firmly on building conceptual understanding rather than detailed mathematical manipulation.
This module is 15 credits and consists of two assessments. The course credit percentages for the two assignments are 30% and 70%, respectively.

The first evaluation - group pre (30%), this group work our group studied the impact of land use rate on food desertification. I was responsible for most of the code implementation in the project. 

btw, I met a very appreciative teammate in this group assignment. She sees the problem very sharply, is very efficient in doing things, and has a high emotional intelligence 👍 -> https://github.com/YijingZhang1206

The second evaluation - individual written investigation (70%), this is a personal project, the homework requires you to find the research question and carry out quantitative analysis on the corresponding data set. The question I researched was: Why is Birmingham the most accessible to health among the top five most metropolitan cities in the UK. My research idea is to ask questions based on phenomena (Birmingham is...the highest). Such a macro-frame analysis is more detailed and convenient than asking questions and finding answers based on data sets. According to the data set, I put forward two hypotheses, and explained the verification method for the two hypotheses in the methodology, and finally got the corresponding results (see the document for details)

### Chinese:
该模块旨在展示定量方法在研究中发挥的不可或缺的作用。将向学生介绍统计、建模和数据分析领域的一系列定量方法，以用作其他学科的工具。在整个课程中，重点将坚定地放在建立概念理解上，而不是详细的数学操作上。
该模块为 15 学分，包含两个评估。两项作业的课程学分百分比分别为30%、70%。

第一次评估 - 小组pre（30%），这个group work我们小组研究了 土地利用率对食品荒漠化的影响程度。我在项目中负责了大部分代码实现部分。btw，在这个小组作业中遇到一个很欣赏的队友,看问题很一针见血，做事很有效率，情商也很高👍 -> https://github.com/YijingZhang1206 

第二次评估 - individual written investigation（70%），这是一个个人项目，作业要求自己找到研究问题以及对应数据集展开量化分析。我研究的问题是：为什么伯明翰是英国大都市程度排前五的城市中健康可达性最高的。我的研究思路是根据现象提出问题（伯明翰是...最高的），这样的宏观框架分析相比根据数据集提出问题并找答案会更细化和方便容易。根据数据集我提出了两个假设，并在方法论中对于两个假设阐述了验证方法，最终得到了对应结果（详见文件）

## Individual Reflection:
### English:
This course focuses on quantitative methods, because the course content is similar to the previous CFA. In addition, a lot of content has already been learned in undergraduate, so the overall course is not difficult.

Course difficulty (max score 5🌟): 🌟🌟

### Chinese:
这门课程主修数量方法，因为课程内容和之前学过的CFA类似。除此之外，很多内容在本科已经学过，所以整体课程难度不大。

课程难度（满分5🌟）：🌟🌟
